## Money.co
The Money.co system is a financial planning and budget management solution. Although designed to help people manage their finances more effectively, the system was created as a partial fulfillment in pursuing my CS degree.

## Notes
This project contains an external library for picking dates (jDatePicker) located in the lib folder. If you're having trouble running the program in your device due to this library, please check out: https://github.com/JDatePicker/JDatePicker
